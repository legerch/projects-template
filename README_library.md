# 1. Requirements
## 1.1. C++ Standards

This library requires at least **C++ 11** standard

## 1.2. Dependencies

Below, list of required dependencies:

| Dependencies | VCPKG package | Comments |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| [Qt][qt-official] | / | Library built with **Qt framework** |
| [Google Tests][gtest-repo] | `gtest` | Only needed to run unit-tests |

> Dependency manager [VCPKG][vcpkg-tutorial] is not mandatory, this is only a note to be able to list needed packages

# 2. How to build

This library can be use as an _embedded library_ in a subdirectory of your project (like a _git submodule_ for example) :
1. In the **root** CMakeLists, add instructions :
```cmake
add_subdirectory(MyLibrary) # Or if library is put in a folder "dependencies" : add_subdirectory(dependencies/MyLibrary)
```

1. In the **application/library** CMakeLists, add instructions :
```cmake
# Link needed libraries
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE mylibrary)
```

# 3. How to use

_TODO: Describe how to use library_

# 4. Library details

_TODO: Sections that can be described are: implementation/tips and tricks/alternatives_

# 5. Documentation

All classes/methods has been documented with [Doxygen][doxygen-official] utility and automatically generated at [online website documentation][example-doc-web].

To generate documentation locally, we can use:
```shell
# Run documentation generation
doxygen ./Doxyfile

# Under Windows OS, maybe doxygen is not added to the $PATH
"C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin\doxygen.exe" ./Doxyfile
```
> [!TIP]
> You can also load the _Doxyfile_ into _Doxywizard_ (Doxygen GUI) and run generation.
